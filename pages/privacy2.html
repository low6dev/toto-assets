<p>
  Where personal data is processed because it is necessary for the performance
  of a contract to which you are a party, we will be unable to provide our
  services without the required information.
</p>
<h2>4. Sharing your information</h2>
<p>
  We will share your personal data outside the United Kingdom (UK) or the
  European Economic Area (EEA). This is necessary for the purposes of providing
  our services to you, but we will only share it where appropriate safeguards
  are in place to ensure your personal data is protected to the same standard
  expected within the UK and EEA.
</p>
<p>
  Our App includes links to our social media pages which enable you to view our
  content through selected sites. These applications may collect your IP address
  or Device ID and may set a cookie on your device. When you use one of these
  links, you are sharing information to another website or service and this
  privacy policy will no longer apply. Please read the privacy notices provided
  by the particular social media website you are sharing through before posting
  any personal information using these links.
</p>
<h2>5. Your rights</h2>
<p>
  The GDPR provides you with certain rights in relation to the processing of
  your personal data, including to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Request access to personal data about you (commonly known as a “data subject
    access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we
    hold about you, and to check that we are lawfully processing it
  </li>
  <li>
    Request rectification, correction, or updating to any of the personal data
    that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or
    inaccurate information we hold about you corrected
  </li>
  <li>
    Request personal data provided by you to be transferred in machine-readable
    format (“data portability”)
  </li>
  <li>
    Request erasure of personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or
    remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to
    process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove personal
    data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below)
  </li>
  <li>
    Request the restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables
    you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal data about you (e.g. if
    you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it)
  </li>
  <li>
    Object to the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances.
    This right may apply where the processing of your personal data is based on
    the legitimate interests of Low6
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Some of these rights are not absolute and are subject to various conditions
  under applicable data protection and privacy legislation and the laws and
  regulations to which we are subject. If at any time you decide that you no
  longer wish to be contacted for marketing purposes, or if you would like to
  exercise any of your rights as set out above, you can contact us at
  <a href="mailto:privacy@low6.co.uk">privacy@low6.co.uk</a>. You will not have
  to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other
  rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is
  clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with
  the request in such circumstances.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to the above, please note that you have the right to make a
  complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner’s Office if you are
  concerned about the way in which we are handling your personal data.
</p>
<h2>6. Data retention period</h2>
<p>
  We will retain your personal data for as long as is necessary to provide you
  with our products and ongoing services and for a reasonable period thereafter,
  to enable us to meet our contractual and legal obligations and to deal with
  complaints and claims.
</p>
<p>
  At the end of the retention period, your personal data will be securely
  deleted in accordance with the Low6 Personal Data Retention and Destruction
  Policy and Schedule.
</p>
<h2>7. Contact</h2>
