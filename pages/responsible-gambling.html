<h3>Social Responsibility, Responsible Gaming and low6</h3>
<p>
  low6 prides itself on providing its customers with a first-class service and a
  responsible gambling environment. Whilst we want all our customers to bet
  responsibly and within their means, we acknowledge that the Service Provider
  also has a responsibility as well as the service user to ensure that the
  pastime of gambling does not become problem gambling. When the fun stops,
  gambling should stop. To this end we endeavour to put in place as many
  measures as possible to protect people who are vulnerable to gambling - be
  they underage or have susceptibility to gambling problems.
</p>
<p>
  low6 monitors customer responses to the measures implemented and will continue
  to re-assess and evaluate our policies on Social Responsibility and
  Responsible Gambling.
</p>
<p>
  low6 provides customers with a range of options listed below to assist them to
  gamble responsibly.

<h3>Counselling Directory</h3>
<p>
  The purpose of the site is ultimately to provide the UK with a huge
  counselling support network, enabling those in distress to find a counsellor
  close to them and appropriate for their needs. This is a free, confidential
  service that will hopefully encourage those in distress to seek help. The
  website also contains a number of sections on emotional disorders (types of
  distress section) and provides some useful statistics. Every counsellor on the
  site who has submitted their profile has either sent a copy of their
  qualifications and insurance cover to us, or is registered with a professional
  body online with recognised codes of ethics and practice, this way we can be
  assured of their professionalism.

<h3>Staying in Control of Your Gambling</h3>
<p>
  Whilst the majority of people do gamble within their means, for some gambling
  can become a problem. It may help you to keep control to remember the
  following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Gambling should be entertaining and not seen as a way of making money.
  </li>
  <li>Be aware of your disposable income</li>
  <li>Only gamble what you can afford to lose.</li>
  <li>Remember that the numbers on the screen are REAL MONEY.</li>
  <li>Avoid chasing losses.</li>
  <li>Keep track of the time and amount you spend gambling.</li>
  <li>
    Be secure, ensuring you keep your Account details safe, and away from any
    third party.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you want to have a break from gambling use our self-exclusion option as
    detailed above.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Identifying problem Gambling</h3>
<p>
  If you are concerned that gambling may have taken over your, or someone else's
  life, then the following questions may help you find out:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Do you stay away from work, college or school to gamble?</li>
  <li>Do you gamble to escape from a boring or unhappy life?</li>
  <li>
    When gambling and you run out of money, do you feel lost and in despair and
    need to gamble again as soon as possible?
  </li>
  <li>
    Do you gamble until your last penny is gone, even the fare home or the cost
    of a cup of tea?
  </li>
  <li>
    Have you ever lied to cover up the amount of money or time you have spent
    gambling?
  </li>
  <li>Have others ever criticized your gambling?</li>
  <li>Have you lost interest in your family, friends or hobbies?</li>
  <li>
    After losing, do you feel you must try and win back your losses as soon as
    possible?
  </li>
  <li>
    Do arguments, frustrations or disappointments make you want to gamble?
  </li>
  <li>Do you feel depressed or even suicidal because of your gambling?</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The more you answer yes to these questions, the more likely you are to have a
  serious gambling problem.
</p>
<h3>Under Age Gambling</h3>
<p>
  It is against the law for those under 18 to gamble and low6 takes its
  responsibilities in this regard very seriously, having various systems in
  place to aid in the prevention of under-age gambling. Symbols throughout our
  site indicate that gambling on our website is only permitted by those aged 18
  or over and we reserve the right to ask for proof of age from any customer.
  Customers accounts will be suspended until satisfactory proof of age if
  required is provided.
</p>
<p>
  The police will be contacted in the event of actual or potential underage
  gambling and no winnings will be paid on transactions, however we will return
  stakes to anyone who verifies that they are under 18.
</p>
<h3>Parental Controls</h3>
<p>
  If you wish to monitor or restrict the use of your computers access to the
  internet, you can use one of the following third-party applications:
</p>
<p>
  Cybersitter filtering software allowing parents to add their own sites to
  block:
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cybersitter.com">www.cybersitter.com</a>
</p>
<p>
  Net Nanny filtering software protects children from inappropriate web content:
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.netnanny.com">www.netnanny.com</a>
</p>
<h3>Deposit Limits</h3>
<p>
  By implementing voluntary deposit limits on each account we can help prevent
  problem gamblers from betting more money than they have initially intended to.
  Within the My Account section on the website is the facility for each account
  holder to place a limit on the amount of money that they may deposit to their
  account within a specified period. This limit can also be implemented by our
  Customer Service Team on 0121 2951235. These amounts may be revised downwards
  at any time; however any increase will only be implemented 24 hours following
  the request, allowing the Customer time to reconsider the decision. Our
  Customer Services staff will be happy to provide any further information
  required but are unable to override any limits set by customers.
</p>
<h3>Age Verification</h3>
<p>
  ID3 Global and Risk Guardian Software are integrated into the low6 platform.
  This controls any attempt of using Low 6 from un-authorised jurisdictions and
  identify all users age using age verification searches and checks.
</p>

<h3>Time-outs</h3>
<p>
  If you wish to give yourself a break from gambling, a Time-out will freeze
  your account and it will not be able to be accessed until the time-out has
  finished.
</p>
<p>
  If a customer wishes to give themselves a rest or time-out from using their
  account then they have the option to select a time-out for 1 day, 1 week, 1
  month or any period of time up-to six weeks.
</p>
<h3>Self-exclusion or Opt-out</h3>
<p>
  For those customers who wish to restrict their gambling, we provide a
  self-exclusion facility enabling customers to close their account or accounts
  for a period from 6 months up to 5 years. Any exclusion may, on request can be
  extended for one or more further periods of at least 6 months by contacting
  customer services.
</p>
<p>
  You can self-exclude from betting activity on your account, using the
  self-exclusion section under the "My Account" part of the website or by
  contacting Customer Services on 0121 2951235.
</p>
<p>
  The Self-Exclusion option can be instigated by sending an email to low6 at
  <a href="mailto:info@low6.co.uk">info@low6.co.uk</a> with details of all the
  accounts you have opened with us. During any periods of self-exclusion it will
  not be possible for the account(s) to be re-opened for any reason, whilst low6
  will also do all it can to prevent any new accounts being opened by the
  customer. Please bear in mind that an account that is simply closed rather
  than excluded can be re-opened by the customer at any time. If you wish to
  have your account re-opened, after the self-exclusion period has expired, you
  will need to email low6 with details of the account(s) you require re-opening.
  Your account will then become active after 24 hours.
</p>
<p>
  low6 is part of a multi-operator self-exclusion scheme called GAMSTOP. To
  self-exclude from other operators as well as low6, we recommend that you email
  them on <a href="mailto:gamstop@transformuk.com">gamstop@transformuk.com</a>
