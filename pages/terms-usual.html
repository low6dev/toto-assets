<h2>1. ABOUT YOU</h2>

<h3>Your Age</h3>

1.1 low6 is a gambling site where you can place bets (“Bet”, "Bets") on the
outcome of events selected by low6. It is a condition of you opening an Account
and of your use of that Account that you authorise and represent to low6 that
you are over the age of 18 and that you take responsibility for your own actions
and have the mental capacity to take responsibility for your own actions and can
enter into a legally binding agreement with us. It is an offence for you to
participate in gambling if you are under 18 years of age.
<p>
  1.2 During the registration of your Account we will undertake an age
  verification process using the details we obtain from you. low6 uses GBG ID3
  Global to undertake these checks. The details we obtain may be checked against
  a variety of identity databases. We may also ask you for specific proof of
  identification (such as a copy of your passport or driving licence). We may
  also at times use your information to pursue other identity checks.
</p>

<p>
  1.3 If your age cannot be verified within the first 48 hours after opening an
  Account and depositing funds, your Account may be frozen. For the Account to
  be re-activated, you will need to provide us with copies of any relevant
  identification documentation as we may request.

  conditions. You will not be permitted to bet with low6 or any of its partners
  if you are employed by low6 or are a sports professional from the low6 partner
  sport. So for example a professional footballer will not be permitted to bet

  jurisdiction in which a Player is based, if the Player is suspected to be
  underage and/or the verification of his/her identity has not been completed.
  Similarly, if we have reason to believe the Site or a sporting event on which
  Bets may be offered has been manipulated or there are sports integrity issues
  associated with a Player’s Account, we reserve the right to void Bets and
  close the Player’s Account.

  or equivalent as soon as practicable from the point of the qualifying event,
  but in exceptional circumstances the crediting of an Account may take up to 3
  working days from such point. Notwithstanding the provisions of clause 2.24
  above if a bonus applied to your Account is not used within 3 months of its
  application Low6 reserves the right to remove such bonus.
</p>

<p>

<h3>Betting Game Play Rules</h3>

<p>
  4.5 Players bet on the outcome of multiple related events which are
  pre-selected by Low6 ("Legs")/(“Races”) and decided over a set period of time
  ("Game Period").
</p>

<p>
  4.6 The Legs/Races in any Game Period shall be selected by low6 acting at its
  sole discretion.
</p>

<h3>Horses</h3>

<p>
  4.7 Event “LOW6” - Players select a horse from each Race/Leg in the event and
  the Player with the lowest accumulated score will be declared the winner of
  the event. The score of each Race/Leg is determined by the finishing position
  of the horse in that Race/Leg. For example, if your horse finishes 1st You
  receive 1 point, finishes 2nd 2 points and so on. If your horse falls or fails
  to complete the Race/Leg You will be given a score corresponding to the
  maximum number of runners in that Race/Leg, so in a 10 runner race You will
  receive 10 points for your selection. Where a Player makes more than 1
  selection per Race/Leg the selection with the lowest score will apply to the
  cumulative total.
</p>

<p>
  4.8 Event LOW6 “5WIN” - As part of the “LOW6” Event a prize will be given to
  the Player who selects 5 correct winners from the 6 Races/legs. To win the
  Low6 “5WIN” prize active selections must be made in all races/legs, Players
  who have non-runners will still qualify as the non-runner rule
</p>

<p>4.17 applies.</p>
<p>
  4.9 Event LOW6 ”WIN6” - As part of the “LOW6” Event a prize will be given to
  the Player who selects 6 correct winners from the 6 Races/legs. To win the
  Low6 “WIN6” prize active selections must be made in all races/legs, Players
  who have non-runners will still qualify as the non-runner rule
</p>

<p>4.17 applies.</p>
<p>
  4.9.1 PLayers can win the LOW6 and 5WIN prize funds in the same bet and
  players can win the LOW6 and WIN6 prize funds in the same bet.
</p>

<p>
  4.10 Event "HIGH6" - As part of the “LOW6” Event a prize will be given to the
  Player with the highest cumulative score. To win the “HIGH6” prize active
  selections must be made in all races/legs, Players who have non-runners will
  still qualify as the non-runner rule
</p>

<p>4.17 applies.</p>
<p>
  4.11 If there are no successful winners for the "5WIN" or “WIN6” prize funds
  then the prize fund for the relevent fund will roll over and will continue
  rolling over until there is a successful "5WIN" or “WIN6” winner. The next
  "5WIN" or “WIN6” funds will be part of the next Low6 game event.
</p>

<p>
  4.12 Players may choose to place one or more Bets per event by perming the
  selections chosen up to a maximum of 64 bets per event, 2 per Leg/Race.
</p>

<p>
  4.13 For any given Leg/Race a Player may make one or more selections of
  alternative results. For example, if you choose horse number 3 and horse
  number 6 in Leg 1 (two selections chosen) and one horse in all other Legs –
  this would constitute to two Bets (two lines). Each Bet has a unit stake of
  £3, so then for this example you will be charged £6. The Low6 bet calculator
  will add up the amount of bets/Lines multiplied by the stake per bets/Lines to
  show the total amount staked on your event up to a maximum of 64 bets/lines
  being £192 maximum stake per event. For the purposes of scoring if two
  selections have been chosen in the same race the score will be used for the
  horse that finishes in the lowest position. So, in this example if horse
  number 6 finishes 2nd and horse number 3 finishes 5th the score of 2 points
  will be allocated to the total score from horse number 6. The score of the
  higher placed horse in this case number 5 will be discarded.
</p>

<p>
  4.14 At least five Legs/Races of the event must take place, for a result to be
  declared. If less than five Legs/Races of an event are completed, all Bets in
  that event will be declared void and stakes will be refunded.
</p>

<p>
  4.15 low6 Horses: Low6 “5WIN”, Low6 “WIN6” will be declared void if less than
  all 6 legs are completed. This excludes stakes rolled over from previous
  events, which will be rolled over for use in future events as determined by
  Low6.
</p>

<p>
  4.16 Event “SUPER LOW6” This is a Saturday only event which runs for a period
  of continuous Saturdays. The event period will be chosen at the discretion of
  Low6. Players must register to Play this event. Players play the “Super low6”
  event every Saturday throughout the chosen period. The Players scores every
  Saturday are then added to their previous weeks’ score giving a cumulative
  running total throughout the period of Play. The Player with the lowest
  cumulative total from the period wins the first prize. If a Player misses a
  Saturday, the highest cumulative score from the chosen “SUPER LOW6” event from
  that Saturday will be added to the Players cumulative score. There is no

  included. All selections in a void Leg will be treated as a score of 185
  points for the purpose of the event.
</p>

<p>

  events.
</p>

<p>
  4.56 low6 reserves the right to reverse the settlement of an event if it has
  been settled in error (for example, a human or technical error). If low6

  balances to reflect changes in event settlements.
</p>

<p>
  4.57 Notwithstanding anything else in these Terms and Conditions of Play, once
  an event has been settled for 24 hours, its settlement will be considered full
  and final.
</p>

<p>
  4.58 Notwithstanding the provisions of the clauses above, in circumstances
  where low6 reasonably believes that a basketball match (whether started or
  not) will not be completed within the same time frame of its scheduled start
  date, low6 reserves the right to declare the match to be a void Leg at that
  point for the purpose of relevant events (irrespective of whether the match is

  than one winner the prize fund will be divided between the winners.
</p>

<h3>Time periods and Errors</h3>

<p>
  4.60 References above within this clause to a particular 'time' shall mean the
  end of the day in local time (where the relevant fixture, event or tournament
  is taking place) would mean that the deadline for completion of that match
  would be 23.59:59 local time at the end of that day.
</p>

<h3>Football</h3>
<h3>Horse Racing</h3>
<h3>Darts</h3>

<p>
  4.61 Event Low6 Picks, PDC Picks and FIVER games, are question and answer

  on that event.
</p>

<h3>Abandoned or Cancelled Events or matches</h3>

<p>
  4.70 In the circumstances of a part abandoned or cancelled event, if 50% or
  more of game play questions are completed then the score at the time of
  abandonment or cancellation will stand and the event score will be completed.
  So for example if there are 6 questions of the event and 3 are completed the
  score at that point will stand. If 2 questions are completed which is less
  than 50% then all stakes will be refunded on that event.
</p>

<p>

  game play. This minimum prize fund will be guaranteed even if the game play
  stakes entered doesn't reach this amount. Once the entered stakes total
  exceeds the minimum prize fund the prize fund will increase accordingly
  following every entry.
</p>

<p>
  4.73 In certain events a player may select a “None of the above” option as
  their entry. Where a “None of the above” entry would result in multiple
  scoring positions being allocated to a player only the highest scoring
  position will be allocated.
